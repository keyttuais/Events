        <h1>The History of Gunpowder</h1>
    </header>

    <p class="intro">
        Gunpowder has a long history that spans from ancient Chinese alchemy to the battlefield tactics of the Mughal Empire. 
        Here is the breakdown of its discovery, its arrival in India, and the pivotal moments of its use.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. The Invention: 9th Century China</h2>
        <p>Gunpowder was invented in China during the <strong>9th century (Tang Dynasty)</strong>. Ironically, it was discovered by Taoist alchemists who were searching for an "elixir of immortality."</p>
        <p>Instead of a life-extending potion, they mixed saltpeter (potassium nitrate), sulfur, and charcoal to create an explosive powder. By the 11th century, the first recorded chemical formula appeared in the Chinese military manual <em>Wujing Zongyao</em>.</p>

        <h2>2. Arrival in India: 13th - 14th Century</h2>
        <p>The popular belief that Babur brought gunpowder to India in 1526 is a common misconception. Research shows it arrived much earlier:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Introduction (13th Century):</strong> It is believed the Mongols brought gunpowder technology to India in the mid-1200s.</li>
            <li><strong>Early Use:</strong> By the late 13th century (during the reign of Jalaluddin Khalji), records mention "fire rockets" (<em>Hawai</em>) in Delhi.</li>
            <li><strong>Expansion (15th Century):</strong> By the 1400s, gunpowder was being used in the Deccan (South-Central India) by the Bahmani Sultanate and the Vijayanagara Empire, primarily for siege warfare and fireworks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. The First Large-Scale Use: First Battle of Panipat (1526)</h2>
        <p>While gunpowder existed in India for over 200 years, the <strong>First Battle of Panipat in 1526</strong> is the most significant because it was the first time field artillery (cannons) and muskets were used on a massive, decisive scale in an open-field battle.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Feature</th>
                    <th>Details</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Commanders</strong></td>
                    <td>Babur (Mughal) vs. Ibrahim Lodi (Delhi Sultanate)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>The Weaponry</strong></td>
                    <td>Babur deployed roughly 20 cannons and matchlock musketeers.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>The Tactic</strong></td>
                    <td>He used the <em>Araba</em> (wagons tied together) to shield his cannons and the <em>Tulughma</em> (flanking) maneuver.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>The Impact</strong></td>
                    <td>The thunderous sound of the cannons panicked Lodi’s elephants, causing them to turn back and trample their own troops.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Though Babur popularized field artillery, some historians note that Mahmud Gawan of the Bahmani Sultanate used gunpowder in the siege of Belgaum as early as 1472, but it lacked the revolutionary scale and strategic impact seen at Panipat.
